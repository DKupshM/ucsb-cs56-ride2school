# A Little suggestion here (from your mentor)
Hi since the goal for this project is to write a minimum viable product, I would suggest focusing on the issues that is fundamental to the project (such as usable a database and a good-looking UI). And after you have decided which issues you will be working on, please let me know by adding some comments under that issue. Thank you.

Hi this is your mentor Derek, this is gonna be a pretty tough project given the very limited time and the complexity of frameworks. So if guys need help with your projects/labs feel free to send me an email. Or you can arrange an appointment with me on Tuesday anytime in the afternoon (except 2:00 - 3:30).
