Hi this is your mentor Derek, this is gonna be a pretty tough project given the very limited time and the complexity of frameworks. So if guys need help with your projects/labs feel free to send me an email. Or you can arrange an appointment with me on Tuesday anytime in the afternoon (except 2:00 - 3:30). 
email:guancheng_ren@umail.ucsb.edu
